TODO:
- Read the excel content (get (company, brn) rows)
- Decide the page layout (how many rows/cols per PNG, cell sizes)
- Draw the design (background, headers, alternating rows, borders)
- Place text nicely (wrapping + centering)
- Automate (loop pages (for each sheet), save files, add command-line options (so that we can change some variable through command line))
